🚦 SafePath AI – Your Journey, Our Protection
SafePath AI is a next-gen, AI-powered navigation platform designed to prioritize safety over speed, 
especially for women, students, and vulnerable travelers. By integrating real-time data, machine learning,
and public datasets, SafePath AI intelligently maps out the safest, smartest, and fastest route—so users can travel with peace of mind.

🛡️ Real-World Problem
Conventional apps like Google Maps focus on the fastest path, often ignoring safety.This has led to several real-life safety incidents across Indian cities:
Misrouting to isolated or under-construction areas.
Exposure to high-crime zones or poorly-lit streets.
Women being chased or stranded due to unsafe navigation.

💡 Our Solution
✅ SafePath AI uses:
AI + ML models for route optimization based on safety.
Crowdsourced inputs and government datasets.
A Safety Score Model for each route.
Visual maps with high-risk zones in red, safe routes in blue.
🔍 Key Features
🚔 Crime-aware routing (via NCRB data)
💡 Lighting & surveillance zone mapping
👮‍♀️ Police station & emergency services proximity
🧠 ML-based Safety Score (Random Forest + XGBoost)
📍 Interactive mapping with Mappls API
📊 Real-time risk visualization
📱 GIS-ready mobile integration
